# Pre-Calculus_Anki

## Project Overview

Pre-Calculus_Anki is a collaborative project aimed at enhancing Pre-Calculus Anki decks. This project is all about facilitating effective learning through spaced repetition. We leverage MathJax for mathematical notation to ensure precise and accurate representation of mathematical concepts. The content is sourced from reputable resources such as Paul's Online Notes, Wikipedia, and MIT OpenCourseWare. If you're looking to master Pre-Calculus concepts, this project is for you!

## Setup/Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Anki installed on your machine. If you haven't already, you can download it from [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

Once you have Anki installed:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/Pre-Calculus_Anki.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and import the deck into Anki.
   ```
   File > Import > Choose the deck file
   ```

## Usage Examples

After importing the deck, you can start reviewing the cards. Each card contains a pre-calculus concept, problem, or theory. By reviewing these cards regularly, you can reinforce your understanding and recall of pre-calculus concepts.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in enhancing these Anki decks. Here are some ways you can contribute:

1. **Content creation:** Improve the existing cards or add new cards to the deck.
2. **Bug reports:** If you find any errors in the cards, please report them.
3. **Feature requests:** If you have ideas for new features or improvements, we'd love to hear them.

When contributing, please ensure your changes are in line with the project's style guidelines and that your commit messages are descriptive.
