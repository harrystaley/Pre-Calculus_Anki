# Pre-Calculus_Anki

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Pre-Calculus_Anki repository! This project is a collaborative effort aimed at enhancing the learning experience for students tackling pre-calculus. By utilizing Anki, a popular spaced repetition software, we aim to create and refine decks that help in memorizing and understanding pre-calculus concepts more effectively.

The decks are enriched with MathJax to accurately display mathematical notation and are sourced from reputable educational resources including Paul's Online Notes, Wikipedia, and MIT OpenCourseWare. This ensures that the content is not only reliable but also comprehensive.

### Project Structure

- **/decks**: Contains the Anki deck files (.apkg) ready for import.
- **/sources**: Documentation and links to all the sources used for creating the cards.
- **/scripts**: Any scripts used to generate the cards, if applicable.
- **/docs**: Additional documentation like project setup, usage guides, and contribution guidelines.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Anki**: You must have Anki installed on your computer to use the decks. Anki is available for free and can be downloaded from [AnkiWeb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

### Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pre-Calculus_Anki.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the repository folder**:
   ```bash
   cd Pre-Calculus_Anki
   ```
3. **Import the Anki deck(s)**:
   - Open Anki.
   - Select `File` > `Import`.
   - Browse to the `/decks` folder and select the deck file you wish to import.

## Usage Examples

After importing the decks into Anki, you can start using them right away. Here is how you can make the most out of these decks:

- **Regular Review**: Make it a habit to review the cards daily. Anki's algorithm will help you focus on cards that need more attention.
- **Custom Study Sessions**: Create custom study sessions if you need to focus on particular topics or concepts before exams or quizzes.
- **Update and Customize**: Feel free to add new cards or edit existing ones to tailor the content to your specific learning needs.
